# PathFinder-algorithms

**Functionalities**:
- 2D editor for pathfinder
- breadth first search algorithm
- greedy algorithm 
- A* algorithm - possibility that it's not working well with diagonal movement (fCost not updated for closedVector Tile)

ToDo:
- *compare* algorithms options with two algorithms working in the same time

ToFix:
- optimize code
- display changes
